To run this part of the assignment please `cd` into the `src` directory. The type the following commands:
```
javac solution2.java
java solution2 <NUM-HOURS>
```
If `NUM-HOURS` is not specified the default value is 1.

I attempted to account for every edge case I could think of and as such some parts of the code are a bit messy. However, through generous use of comments I hope I have made my thought process and implementation as easy to understand as possible.

Thank you and have an excellent day!
